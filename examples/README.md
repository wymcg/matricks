# Matricks Plugin Examples
This folder contains basic examples for several of the languages supported by Matricks. 
Each of these examples will fade the entire matrix from black to white, and then halt the plugin and send a log.
Build instructions for each example are given each example's README.

If you're looking for some examples of some more complicated plugins, check out a few of these repositories:
